# Bubble-sort

Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. 
The method works by examining each set of adjacent elements 
in the string, from left to right, switching their positions if they are out of order.
Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
It does not require any additional memory space.
Itâ€™s adaptability to different types of data.

Algorithm:

begin BubbleSort(arr)

  for all array elements  

if arr[i] > arr[i+1]  

swap(arr[i], arr[i+1])  

end if  

end for     

return arr     

end
